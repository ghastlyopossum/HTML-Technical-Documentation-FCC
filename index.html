            HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, serves as the fundamental markup
            language for creating and structuring content on the World Wide Web.
            Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), HTML utilizes a
            system of tags to define elements within a document, outlining their
            purpose and relationship. These elements encompass everything from
            headings, paragraphs, and lists to images, hyperlinks, and
            interactive forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML acts as the skeleton of a web page, providing a hierarchical
            structure that browsers use to render content. It facilitates the
            seamless integration of multimedia, scripting languages, and other
            technologies, enabling developers to craft dynamic and engaging web
            experiences.<br />
            Here's an example of a line of code written in HTML:
          </p>
          <code>&ltp&gtHello World&lt/p&gt</code>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Living Standard:</b> Unlike many other programming languages
              and technologies, HTML doesn't have a fixed version. Instead, it
              follows a "living standard" model. The specification is
              continuously updated and improved by the World Wide Web Consortium
              (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
              (WHATWG). This means that HTML is constantly evolving to
              accommodate new features, improvements, and changes in web
              development practices.

              <b>Origins of the Term "Hypertext":</b> The term "Hypertext" in
              HTML's name reflects its initial purpose. When Sir Tim
              Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, conceived HTML in
              the early 1990s, he envisioned a system where documents could be
              linked together through hypertext, allowing users to navigate
              non-linearly through information. This emphasis on hypertextuality
              laid the foundation for the interconnected and hyperlinked nature
              of the web as we know it today.

            Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is a crucial
            component of web development that focuses on the presentation and
            styling of HTML documents. Developed to separate the structure and
            content of a webpage from its visual design, CSS enables developers
            to apply a consistent and visually appealing layout to their HTML
            elements. Through a declarative syntax, CSS provides rules and
            styles that define how HTML elements should be displayed on a user's
            browser, covering aspects such as fonts, colors, spacing, and
            positioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "cascading" nature of CSS allows for a hierarchy of styles,
            where rules can be inherited, overridden, or combined, providing
            flexibility and efficiency in the styling process. By implementing
            CSS, developers can create responsive, aesthetically pleasing web
            pages while maintaining a clear distinction between content and
            presentation. This documentation will delve into the intricacies of
            CSS, offering insights into selectors, properties, and best
            practices to empower developers in crafting visually engaging and
            user-friendly web experiences.<br />
            Here's an example of a line of code written in CSS:
          </p>
          <code
            >.class-name {<br />
            font-weight: bold;<br />
            text-transform: uppercase;<br />
            }</code
          >
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Origin of the Name "Cascading Style Sheets":</b> The term
              "cascading" in CSS refers to the cascade of styles applied to HTML
              elements based on their specificity and order of appearance in the
              stylesheet. Interestingly, this cascading behavior was inspired by
              the design principles of desktop publishing software like Adobe's
              PostScript and PDF, where styles could be defined at various
              levels, allowing for a similar hierarchy in the application of
              formatting rules.

              <b>CSS Animations - The Hidden Dinosaur Game:</b> As a delightful
              Easter egg hidden within Google Chrome's Developer Tools, CSS has
              an unexpected and amusing feature. If you happen to encounter a
              page with a 404 error and access the Developer Tools, you can
              activate a hidden dinosaur game by triggering a CSS animation. To
              do this, simply open the console, type
              Runner.instance_.setSpeed(10) and press Enter. This increases the
              speed of the dinosaur, turning your error page into an interactive
              game where you control a speedy T-Rex, jumping over cacti. This
              whimsical use of CSS animations showcases the playful side of web
              development and adds a touch of fun to an otherwise error-ridden
              experience.

        <header>Basic command structures of HTML</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In HTML, the fundamental building blocks are defined by a series of
            tags, forming the basic command structures that dictate the
            structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle
            brackets, and most come in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a
            closing tag. The opening tag identifies the beginning of an HTML
            element, while the closing tag, preceded by a forward slash, marks
            its end. For example, the &lthtml&gt tag encapsulates the entire
            HTML document, &lthead&gt contains metadata like the page title, and
            &ltbody&gt wraps the visible content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within these structural tags, a variety of elements such as headings
            (&lth1&gt to &lth6&gt), paragraphs (&ltp&gt), lists (&ltul&gt,
            &ltol&gt, &ltli&gt), and hyperlinks (&lta&gt) can be employed to
            organize and present content. Additionally, attributes within tags
            provide additional information or modify the behavior of elements.
            Understanding and manipulating these basic command structures is
            essential for crafting well-organized and semantically meaningful
            HTML documents.<br />
            For example this is how a basic HTML website is structured:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
              &lthtml lang="en"&gt
              &lthead&gt
                  &ltmeta charset="UTF-8"&gt
                  &ltmeta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt
                  &lttitle&gtDocument&lt/title&gt
              &lt/head&gt
              &ltbody&gt
              &lt/body&gt
              &lt/html&gt</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            You might have noticed that certain tags need to be ended with "/"
            and some do not:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              &ltmeta charset="UTF-8" /&gt <----  (Doesn't need a second tag)
              &lthtml&gt&lt/html&gt <----  (Needs a second tag to work)
            </code>
         </pre>
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_command_structures_of_CSS">
        <header>Basic command structures of CSS</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In CSS, the basic command structures revolve around rules that
            define how HTML elements should be styled and presented on a web
            page. A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The
            selector identifies the HTML element or elements to which the styles
            will be applied, and the declaration block, enclosed in curly
            braces, contains one or more declarations. Each declaration
            comprises a property and a value, separated by a colon. For
            instance, color: blue; within a declaration block sets the text
            color to blue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Selectors can be simple, targeting specific HTML elements like p for
            paragraphs, or more complex, employing classes (.class) and IDs
            (#id) to target specific elements. Additionally, CSS supports
            various units for values, such as pixels, percentages, and ems,
            allowing for flexible and responsive design. The separation of
            content and presentation is a key principle, and by understanding
            these basic command structures, developers can wield CSS effectively
            to create visually appealing and consistent styles across their web
            projects.<br />
            You can target basic elements like this:
          </p>
          <code
            >p {<br />
            text-align: justify;<br />
            }</code
          >
          <p>
            As you can see when it's a basic element you just need to write it
            as is. For class or ID elements, however, certain indicators need to
            be given:
          </p>
          <code>
            Classes need '.' before them:<br />
            .class-name {<br />
            font-weight: bold;<br />
            }
            <br />
            ID tags need to use '#':<br />
            #ID-name {<br />
            font-weight: bold;<br />
            }
          </code>
